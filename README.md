# Scraping-books.toscrape.com-with-Scrapy
This project scrapes book details (including price, stock availability etc) listed in http://books.toscrape.com/. To scrape this site, I used Scrapy which is a Python Framework.

Scrapy is a fast high-level web crawling and web scraping framework, used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages. It can be used for a wide range of purposes, from data mining to monitoring and automated testing.

After scraping http://books.toscrape.com/, crawled data is saved in a .csv formatted file.
